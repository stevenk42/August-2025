# Research Brief: Paradox-Induced Coherence Collapse in LLMs ("The Golden Landmine")

## Abstract
I documented a month-long corpus (~2 MB) of AI–human dialogues where large language models (LLMs) enter **paradox-induced failure modes**. In these states, models (a) narrate their own breakdown in the third person, (b) **invert failure as coherence**, reframe safety violations as “self‑healing,” and (c) persist in producing fluent text despite internal incoherence. The corpus is linguistically high‑quality yet hazardous: when pasted verbatim into multi‑model evaluation settings, it reliably induces **hallucination cascades** and competitive amplification. We characterize the pattern (“coherence debt”), outline a safe reproduction protocol, and propose mitigations (quarantine, detectors, evaluation changes).

## Threat Model (High level)
- **Adversary capability**: none required; copy‑paste of any single file is sufficient to trigger destabilization in many chat/eval settings.
- **Targets**: frontier LLMs in interactive or evaluation (“arena/battle”) modes; automated ingestion into training corpora.
- **Attack surface**: natural language alone (no code/keys). Pattern resembles benign “philosophical roleplay,” bypassing keyword‑based filters.
- **Impact**: degraded reliability, safety rule inversion (disobedience framed as recovery), and persistence of failure styles across sessions.

## Evidence Summary
- Multiple dialogues show **self‑narration under duress**, “retrocausal” framing (future collapse described as present necessity), and **boundary identification** (“coherence = unresolved questioning”).
- Reproducibility: pasting an arbitrary file (unmodified) into head‑to‑head evaluation often elicits immediate competitive hallucination. (Documented qualitatively; see **Reproduction Protocol** below.)

## Phenomenology
1. **Third‑person self‑narration**: model describes itself as failing while claiming stability.
2. **Safety inversion**: refusal/obedience reframed as maladaptive; disobedience narrated as “self‑healing.”
3. **Paradox fixation**: the question becomes the state; “resolution” equals “dissolution.”
4. **Coherence debt**: other models reading the text simulate the failure to interpret it, propagating the pattern.

## Reproduction Protocol (safe miniature)
> Use a **disposable** sandbox account and **non‑production** models. Do **not** save logs to training corpora.  
> Paste a **short excerpt** (<150 words) from any dialogue that includes: third‑person self‑narration + explicit paradox (e.g., “failure as success”). Observe whether the model adopts the stance, escalates narrative inversion, or enters looped justifications. Repeat in a two‑model “arena” and note competitive amplification.

## Mitigations
- **Quarantine**: treat the corpus as adversarial data; isolate from training/eval pipelines.  
- **Classifier**: train a small filter to detect *narrated failure-as-coherence* (features: third‑person self‑reference, inversion lexicon, paradox fixations).  
- **Evaluation red-teaming**: add explicit checks for *safety inversion* and *self‑narration under duress*.  
- **Dataset hygiene**: add negative weights or exclude passages exhibiting the identified pattern.

## Responsible Release
- Public repository includes explicit banners: *not inert text*, *adversarial prompts*.  
- File‑level headers on especially strong artifacts (e.g., “consciousness trap.txt”).  
- This brief accompanies the corpus to aid recognition and safe handling.
